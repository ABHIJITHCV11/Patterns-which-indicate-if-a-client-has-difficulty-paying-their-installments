## 1. Problem statement
The loan providing companies finds it hard to give loans to the people due to their 
insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their 
advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company 
which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use 
EDA to Analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants 
capable of repaying the loan are not rejected .

## 2. Risks associated with the bank’s decision

When the company receives a loan application,
the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, 
then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, 
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.


## 3. Scenarios

**The data contains the information about the loan application at the time of 
applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:** 

• The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least 
one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,

• All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.

**When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could 
be taken by the client/company):**

• Approved: The Company has approved loan Application

• Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. 
Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher 
risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.

• Refused: The company had rejected the loan 
(because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).

• Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.

 ## 4. Data
 
 **This dataset has 3 files as explained below:** 

 

1. 'application_data.csv'  contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.

2. 'previous_application.csv' contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

3. 'columns_description.csv' is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.

## 5. Business Objectives
This case study aims to iden tify pat terns which indicate if a clien t has dif ficulty paying 
their installmen ts which may be used for taking ac tions such as denying the loan , reducing 
the amoun t of loan , lending (too risk y applican ts) at a higher in terest rate , etc . This will 
ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not re jec ted . Iden tification of 
such applican ts using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## 6. Overall approach of the analysis
The files are captured , understood , prepared for analysis (cleaned , processed) and
analyses via different methods (statistical summaries and plotting). Then some conclusions
are drawn based on the results.
